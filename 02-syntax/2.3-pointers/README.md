## Pointers

Pointers provide a way to share data across program boundaries. Having the ability to share and reference data with a pointer provides the benefit of efficiency. There is only one copy of the data and everyone can see it changing. The cost is that anyone can change the data which can cause side effects in running programs.

## Notes

* Use pointers to share data.
* Values in Go are always pass by value.
* "Value of", what's in the box. "Address of" ( **&** ), where is the box.
* The (*) operator declares a pointer variable and the "Value that the pointer points to".

## Escape Analysis

* When a value could be referenced after the function that constructs the value returns.
* When the compiler determines a value is too large to fit on the stack.
* When the compiler doesnâ€™t know the size of a value at compile time.
* When a value is decoupled through the use of function or interface values.

## Garbage Collection History

The design of the Go GC has changed over the years:
* Go 1.0, Stop the world mark sweep collector based heavily on tcmalloc.
* Go 1.2, Precise collector, wouldn't mistake big numbers (or big strings of text) for pointers.
* Go 1.3, Fully precise tracking of all stack values.
* Go 1.4, Mark and sweep now parallel, but still stop the world.
* Go 1.5, New GC design, focusing on latency over throughput.
* Go 1.6, GC improvements, handling larger heaps with lower latency.
* Go 1.7, GC improvements, handling larger number of idle goroutines, substantial stack size fluctuation, or large package-level variables.
* Go 1.8, GC improvements, collection pauses should be significantly shorter than they were in Go 1.7, usually under 100 microseconds and often as low as 10 microseconds.
* Go 1.9, Large object allocation performance is significantly improved in applications using large (>50GB) heaps containing many large objects.
* Go 1.10, Many applications should experience significantly lower allocation latency and overall performance overhead when the garbage collector is active.

## Garbage Collection Semantics

## Stack vs Heap

_"The stack is for data that needs to persist only for the lifetime of the function that constructs it, and is reclaimed without any cost when the function exits. The heap is for data that needs to persist after the function that constructs it exits, and is reclaimed by a sometimes costly garbage collection." - Ayan George

Remember, the lack of performance is gonna come from **four** places. 
1. **Latency** around networking, disk I/O, etc. 
2. Allocations and memory, garbage collection. 
3. How we access data .
4. Algorithm efficiency. 

---

Everything in Go is **pass by value**. 
- When I say pass by value, what I mean is WYSIWYG. 

---

#### Behind the Scenes - Part 1 

Remember
- **G**: Goroutine
- **P**: Logical Processor
- **M**: OS Thread
- **C**: Core

When your Go program starts up, it's gonna be given a **`P`** or a **logical processor** for every **core** (**`C`**) that's identified on the host machine. 

That **`P`** is given a _real live_ **operating system thread** that we call **`M`**.
 
That **`M`** is going be scheduled by the operating system scheduler on a particular core.

We get one more thing from the run time, and that is our **goroutine**, our **`G`**. 

---

#### Behind the Scenes - Part 2 

**Path of Execution**

**Threads** are our **path of execution** at the **operating system** level. 

All code at some point gets into **machine code**, and the operating system's job is to choose a path of execution, a thread to execute those instructions one after the other, starting from `main`. That's the job of the thread. 

---

There's **3** areas of memory that we may talk about throughout the class. 
1. The Data Segment 
    - usually reserved for global variables and read-only values
2. Stacks
3. Heaps 

We're going focus on stacks and heaps.

---

#### Behind the Scenes - Part 3

**Stacks**

A stack is a data structure that every thread is given. 

At the operating system level, your stack is a **contiguous** block of memory and usually it's allocated to be **1MG**. 

**1MG** of memory for every stack, and therefore for every thread. 

**`G`**s are very much like **`M`**s; we could almost say that they're the same but **`G`** above the operating system. 

A **`G`** has a stack of memory; **2K** in size (a lot lot smaller than **1MG**) 


#### Behind the Scenes - Part 4

By the time the goroutine that was created for this Go program wants to execute main, it's already executed a bunch of code from the run time. 

Any time a goroutine makes a function call, what it's going to do is take some memory off the stack. We call this a frame of memory. 

Remember, every line of code we write is either reading memory or writing memory. Obviously, also allocating at some point. 

The goroutine only has **direct** access to memory for the frame that it is operating on - called the **active frame**. 

The stack frame is serving a really important purpose. It's creating a sandbox, a layer of isolation. 

#### Behind the Scenes - Part 5

**Mechanics and Semantics** 
- Mechanics: how things work. 
- Semantics: how things behave. 

---

Every time you make a **function call**, what we're really doing is crossing over a **program boundary**. 

Program boundaries are important to identify, because it means that we're gonna be moving out of this sandbox or frame and we're gonna be moving into a new one. 

Every time we call a function, what's going to happen is we're going to slice a new frame off the stack. 

This is where the idea of **parameters** comes from. Parameters are really serving a mechanical purpose on top of our design purpose, and that is to get data inside of this new frame so the goroutine can operate this new data transformation in a level of isolation with a level of immutability. 

**_Everything_** in Go is **passed by value**, what that means is that we're gonna make a **copy** of the data as it goes across the boundary. 

There's two types of data that we operate with; the **value itself** or the **value's address**. Yes, addresses are data, and I want you to always understand that. 

When you pass the **data value itself** into a parameter, this is called **value semantics**. 

When you pass the **data value's address** into a parameter, this is called **pointer semantics**.
